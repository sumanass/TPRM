**Automating Third Party Risk Management Process**
**Introduction**
As organizations increasingly rely on third-party vendors, managing the associated risks becomes a critical challenge. This project aims to create a comprehensive system for automating and enhancing the Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) process. By leveraging Python, AI, and data analytics, we can streamline vendor risk assessments, continuous monitoring, and reporting.

**Features**
**Automated Questionnaire Selection:**
The proposed system selects and sends the right risk assessment questionnaires based on the vendor category. For instance, a software vendor would receive a different set of questions than a Data provider. This ensures that we're asking the right questions to assess their specific risks.

**Smart Response Analysis:**
Once vendors submit their responses, the system analyzes them to identify missing information, areas that need follow-up, and positive aspects. This step is crucial for ensuring that we have a complete picture of each vendor's risk profile.

**AI-Powered Finding Generation:**
Using natural language processing (NLP) to automatically generate standardized risk findings. These findings include a risk rating and a clear rationale for why a remediation plan is necessary. This not only saves time but also ensures consistency across all assessments.

**Continuous Vendor Monitoring:**
The system collects and stores vendor data from various external sources. This allows us to continuously assess vendor risks and respond quickly to any changes.

**Dynamic Risk Dashboard:**
Leadership can access a user-friendly dashboard that provides real-time risk metrics and insights. This enables informed decision-making and proactive risk management.

**Technical requirements**
Python: The core programming language for all components of the system.

SQLite: For storing vendor data and monitoring results

Hugging Face Transformers: This library powers AI-driven text generation for creating risk findings.

Dash: To build interactive dashboard using Dash, which provides a seamless user experience.

Plotly: Data visualization is handled by Plotly, ensuring that complex data is presented clearly.

Requests library: For making API calls to external data sources

Schedule: The Schedule library helps to automate periodic data collection tasks.

**Project Structure**
Questionnaire Selection Module:
This module selects the appropriate questionnaire based on the vendor category and simulates sending it to the vendor.

**Response Analysis Module**:
Here, we analyze vendor responses using predefined rules to identify gaps and strengths.

**AI Finding Generator:**
This module uses a GPT model to generate standardized risk findings, incorporating risk levels and specific issues.

**Continuous Monitoring Script:**
We collect vendor data from external APIs and store it in our SQLite database for trend analysis.

**Leadership Dashboard:**
The dashboard visualizes vendor risk data using interactive charts and provides AI-generated insights on the overall risk landscape.

**Future Plans**
Machine Learning Integration: We plan to integrate machine learning models to improve risk prediction accuracy.

GRC Platform Integration: Future enhancements include integrating with enterprise GRC platforms for seamless risk management.

Expanded Data Sources: We aim to expand our data sources for continuous monitoring to ensure comprehensive risk coverage.

Advanced NLP Models: Developing more sophisticated NLP models will further enhance response analysis and finding generation.

**Conclusion**
This Automated TPRM System represents a significant step forward in managing third-party risks efficiently. By combining cutting-edge technologies with practical business needs, we can ensure that organizations are better equipped to handle the complexities of vendor risk management.
